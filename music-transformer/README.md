# music-transformer

The [Music Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04281), or Transformer Decoder with Relative Self-Attention, is a deep learning sequence model designed to generate music. It builds upon the Transformer architecture to consider the relative distances between different elements of the sequence rather than / along with their absolute positions in the sequence. I explored my interest in AI-generated music through this project and learned quite a bit about current research in the field of AI in terms of both algorithms and architectures. This repository contains Python scripts to preprocess MIDI data, train a pre-LayerNorm Music Transformer using PyTorch, as well as to generate MIDI files with a trained (or if you're brave, untrained) Music Transformer. It also contains three of my own trained Music Transformers that can be used to generate music.

While the data preprocessing and generation functionality require MIDI files and the event vocabulary described in [Oore et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03715.pdf) or `vocabulary.py`, anyone should be able to use the `train.py` script to train their own Relative Attention Transformer on any dataset, provided correct specification of hyperparameters, and provided they have properly preprocessed their data into a single PyTorch tensor. Do create an issue if something does not work as expected.

Follow the instructions in the [Generate_Music.ipynb](https://github.com/spectraldoy/music-transformer/blob/main/Generate_Music.ipynb) notebook, or in the [Generate Music!](#generate-music) section of this README to generate your own music with one of my pretrained Music Transformers possibly without having to write any code.

## Key Dependencies
1. PyTorch 2.1.0
2. Mido 1.2.9

## Setting up
Clone, the git repository, cd into it if necessary, and install the requirements. Then you're ready to preprocess MIDI files, as well as train and generate music with a Music Transformer.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/spectraldoy/music-transformer
cd ./music-transformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Generate Music!
Of course the Music Transformer is useless if we can't generate music with it. Given a pretrained Music Transformers's `state_dict` and `hparams` saved at `.../save_path.pt`, and specifying the path at which to save a generated MIDI file, `.../gen_audio.mid`, running the following:
```shell
python generate.py .../save_path.pt .../gen_audio.mid
```
will autoregressively greedy decode the outputs of the Music Transformer to generate a list of token_ids, convert those token_ids back to a MIDI file using functionality from `tokenizer.py`, and will save the output MIDI file at `.../gen_audio.mid`. Parameters for the MIDI generation can also be specified - `'argmax'` or `'categorical'` decode sampling, sampling temperature, the number of top_k samples to consider, and the approximate tempo of the generated audio (for more details, run `python generate.py -h`).

I have uploaded [a few small pretrained Music Transformers](https://github.com/spectraldoy/music-transformer/blob/main/models) to this repository, with which anyone can run this script to generate music. The models are:
1. `model4v2`, containing absolute positional encoding up to 20000 positions and otherwise the exact `hparams` of `hparams.py`, and trained on about 100 MIDI files from the [MAESTRO Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro). 
2. `model6v2`, containing no absolute positional encoding (i.e., being a pure Relative Attention model) and the exact `hparams` of `hparams.py`, and trained on the same set of MIDI files as `model4v2`.
3. `chopintransformerv5`, a pure relative attention model, having the exact `hparams` of `hparams.py`, and being trained on a set of 39 pieces by Chopin. However, it sounds nothing like him. This is arguably my best model.
4. `vgmtransformerv4.pt`, having the exact `hparams` of `hparams.py` and being trained on the `Soundtracks/Video Game Music` folder of the [ADL Piano MIDI Dataset](https://github.com/lucasnfe/adl-piano-midi/). 

To generate music with the `chopintransformerv5`, you can run:
```shell
python generate.py models/chopintransformerv5.pt .../gen_audio.mid -v
```
I have found that a sampling temperature of 0.7-1.0 and top_k of 50-200 work well with this model. Sometimes, however, it doesn't end.

The notebook [Generate_Music.ipynb](https://github.com/spectraldoy/music-transformer/blob/main/Generate_Music.ipynb) allows you to generate music with the models in this repository (by default the Chopin model) using Google's Magenta SoundFont, as well as download any generated audio files, without having to write any underlying code. So for those who wish to play around with these models, go ahead and open that notebook in Google Colab.

## Preprocess MIDI Data
Most sequence models require a general upper limit on the length of the sequences being modeled, it being too computationally or memory expensive to handle longer sequences. So, suppose you have a directory of MIDI files at `.../datapath/` (for instance, any of the folders in the [MAESTRO Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro)), and would like to convert these files into an event vocabulary that can be trained on, cut these sequences to be less than or equal to an approximate maximum length, `lth`, and store this processed data in a single PyTorch tensor (for use with `torch.utils.data.TensorDataset`) at `.../processed_data.pt`. Running the `preprocessing.py` script as follows:
```shell
python preprocessing.py .../datapath/ .../processed_data.pt lth
```
will translate the MIDI files to the event vocabulary laid out in `vocabulary.py`, tokenize it with functionality from `tokenizer.py`, cut the data to approximately the specified `lth`, augment the dataset by a default set of pitch transpositions and stretches in time, and finally, store the sequences as a single concatenated PyTorch tensor at `.../processed_data.pt`. The cutting is done by randomly generating a number from 0 to `lth`, randomly sampling a window of that length from the sequence, and padding with `pad_tokens`s to the maximum sequence length in the data. Pitch transpositions and factors of time stretching can also be specified when running the script from the shell (for details, run `python preprocessing.py -h`).

NOTE: THIS SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY FOR MULTI-TRACK MIDI FILES, AND ANY OTHER INSTRUMENTS WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE CONVERTED TO PIANO.
(the reason for this is that I worked only with single-track piano MIDI for this project)

## Train a Music Transformer
Being highly space complex, as well as requiring inordinate amounts of time to train on both GPUs as well as TPUs, the Music Transformer needs to be checkpointed while training. I implemented a deliberate and slightly unwieldy checkpointing mechanism in the `MusicTransformerTrainer` class from `train.py`, to be able to checkpoint while training a Music Transformer. At it's very simplest, given a path to a preprocessed dataset in the form of a PyTorch tensor, `.../preprocessed_data.pt`, and specifying a path at which to checkpoint the model, `.../ckpt_path.pt`, a path at which to save the model, `.../save_path.pt`, and the number of epochs for which to train the model this session, `epochs`, running the following:
```shell
python train.py .../preprocessed_data.pt .../ckpt_path.pt .../save_path.pt epochs
```
will split the data 80/20 into training and validation sets, train the model for the specified number of `epochs` on the given dataset, printing progress messages, and will checkpoint the optimizer state, learning rate schedule state, model weights, and hyperparameters if a `KeyboardInterrupt` is encountered, anytime a progress message is printed, and when the model finishes training for the specified number of `epochs`. Hyperparameters can also be specified when creating a new model, i.e., not loading from a checkpoint (for details on these, run `python train.py -h`). However, if the `-l` or `--load-checkpoint` flag is also entered:
```shell
python train.py .../preprocessed_data.pt .../ckpt_path.pt .../save_path.pt epochs -l
```
the latest checkpoint stored at `.../ckpt_path.pt` will be loaded, overloading any hyperparameters explicitly specified with the hyperparameters of the saved model, restoring the model, optimizer, and learning rate schedule states, and continuing training from there. Once training is completed, i.e., the model has been trained for the specified number of `epochs`, another checkpoint will be created, and the model's `state_dict` and `hparams` will be stored in a Python dictionary and saved at `.../save_path.pt`.

## Acknowledgements

I trained most of my models on Western classical music from [the MAESTRO Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro). The model trained on Video Game music was trained using a subset of the [ADL Piano MIDI Dataset](https://github.com/lucasnfe/adl-piano-midi/).
