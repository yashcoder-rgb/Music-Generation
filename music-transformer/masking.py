Implementations of masking functionality for training a transformer:
    padding_mask: mask <pad> tokens in input sequences
    look_ahead_mask: mask subsequent positions for masked self-attention calculation
    combined_mask: elementwise maximum of above two
"""


def create_padding_mask(inp, n=4):
    """
    Since some of the input sequences are padded with pad tokens (0), we need to mask out these parts of the input
    sequences so that the model does not treat it as input. The mask will be created as a tensor of the same shape as
    the input with ones in the positions that need to be masked.

    Args:
        inp: unembedded batch of input sequences of shape (batch_size, seq_len)
        n (int): number of dimensions to which to broadcast mask

    Returns:
        mask: tensor of ones of shape (batch_size, 1, ..., 1, seq_len) with ndim=n
              positions to mask are marked with ones
    """
    # find positions in inp equal to pad_token
    mask = torch.eq(inp, pad_token).float()

    # add extra dimensions
    return mask.view(*mask.shape[:-1], *[1 for _ in range(n-2)], mask.shape[-1]).to(inp.device)


def create_look_ahead_mask(seq_len):
    """
    Creates an upper triangular mask of ones of shape (seq_len, seq_len) for the calculation of Scaled Dot Product
    Attention, to prevent the transformer from looking ahead at future tokens, so that the next outputs of the
    model are based only on the current and previous tokens in the input sequence.

    Args:
        seq_len (int): input sequence length; the created mask is dependent only on the sequence length, not
                       on the sequence itself

    Returns:
        mask: upper triangular mask of ones of shape (seq_len, seq_len); easily broadcastable to n dimensions
              positions to mask are marked with ones

def create_mask(inp, n=4):
    """
    The correct final mask for the input will be the maximum of the padding and look_ahead mask, as the elements that
    need to be zeroed are represented by 1's, and those that need to be preserved are represented by 0's.

    Args:
        inp: unembedded batch of input sequences of shape (batch_size, seq_len)
        n (int): number of dimensions to which to broadcast mask

        combined_mask: maximum of padding and look_ahead masks for inp;
                       tensor of ones of shape (batch_size, 1, ..., 1, seq_len, seq_len) with ndim=n
